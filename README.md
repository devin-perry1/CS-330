How do I approach designing software?
    I approach it from a very open mind, and try to think of every way it can get done before choosing one. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    This class taught me how to make 3D object with code, which was pretty awesome!
What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I followed a simple one that allowed me to add each feature as I went along.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    I think taking things step by step is a great way to get something done. Add something, and then another, etc.
How do I approach developing programs?
    I try to keep it as simple as I can so it doesn't get overhwhelming.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I learned a number of things, but mainly to set up a baseline and then work off of it each week.
How did iteration factor into your development?
    Making a number of iterations allowed me to pick the very best one I could.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    It was hard to develop, as I had numerous technical issues. But, I learned how to work swiftly.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    Computer science is a versatile field, and pays well. This is great.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    It will help me in my last few classes for sure. I am almost done!
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    IF I ever go into game design, I am sure this class will be helpful knowledge to have.
